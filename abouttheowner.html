          </section>
          <p><img src="resources/images/OwnerBlakeColoured.JPEG" alt="Picture of Owner" class="left" height="auto" width="290px"> My name is BJ Dillon, and for as long as I can remember, I've wanted to create content. The only thing is I was never that quite sure what that "content" is.</p>
          <p>I was 15 years old when I first held a DSLR camera. Prior to that, I had never really created work beyond some film projects. Taking that camera to the streets of the Melbourne CBD opened my eyes to a world of possibilities waiting to be claimed.However, I realised early on that doing content solely for schoolwork was very limiting.</p>
          <p>I created Three Beat Designs as a creative outlet to really create whatever I wanted to create. Since then, I have been honing my skills and pushing the boundaries of what I think I'm capable of. In late-2017, I started Project Crimson, a series of cryptic and corrupted videos and images that led to the reveal of my student film project, 'The Red Bandit'. I consider it to be my most ambitious project to date.</p>
          <p>This site serves as an ever expanding artpiece; a sanctuary to host the work I want to create, whatever that may be.</p>
