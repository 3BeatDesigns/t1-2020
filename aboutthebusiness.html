          <h3>About the Business</h3>
          <img src="resources/images/TBDLogo Black.png" alt="Picture of Owner" height="auto" width="100px">

          <p>In November of 2017, instead of focusing on my studies, I had an idea for a poster of Blink-182's recent 'California' album, with the lyrics of the songs of the album forming the white spaces of the album cover. When I finished the poster, I posted it to Instagram and went to bed. It was a huge surprise to see in the morning that the official Blink-182 page had liked the post.
          </p>
          <p>Though now it seems insignificant, that one like made me think that maybe this was an idea worth exploring. I set to work on a bunch more posters of my favourite albums, but I realised that if I was going to post these online, I should have a brand name to attach to them. Thus, Three Beat Designs was born.
          </p>
          <p>
          Since then, Three Beat Designs has continued to evolve and expand their reach beyond the niche product that caught the attention of many. The business offers their services to all who see fit, from logos to motion graphics projects. 
          </p>
          <p>The way I see it, Three Beat Designs is purely a design business in name alone.</p>
          <p>Three Beat Designs is a content creation business.</p>
          <p>(whatever that content may be)</p>
